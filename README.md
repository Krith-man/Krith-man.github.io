# About Me 
Hello world! <br>
When I'm not studying, I am usually with my 4 years german shepherd, who loves to run and exercise even more than I do. I love to travel as it offers you the opportunity to interact with different personalities, sharing knowledge and opinions about technology and automotive. So feel free to say hello and discuss anything with me, anything you are interested in! I am more than excited to hear people's stories. <br><br>
Feel free to take a look at my personal [website](https://Krith-man.github.io)!
